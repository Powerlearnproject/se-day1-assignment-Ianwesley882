Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the designing, developing, testing and mantaining of software systems. It enables innovation, ensures reliability and scalability, and also enhances security and data protection.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The birth of software engineering: It was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering conferencein 1968 where the software crisis was addressed because projects often failed due to poor planning and lack increasing complexity.This led to the adoption of the systematic engineering principles in software development, emphasizing structured programing and project management.
2.The rise of Object-Oriented programming: Traditional procedural programming faced challanges in handling large-scale software software systems. Object-Oriented programming emerged with languages like smalltalk, c++ and java. OOP introduced key principles like encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism making softwares more modular,reusable and maintainable.
3.The agile revolution: agile manifesto was intoduced emphasizing flexibility, customer collaboration and iterative development becuase software development followed rigid models which led to effficiencies ad slow adaptation to change.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirement gathering and analysis: Project goals, functionality and technical requirements are collected from clients.
2.System design: System architecture and designs are planned based on the requirements.
3.Implementation: the actual coding and development of the software takes place
4. Testing: the software is tested to identify bugs, errors and descrepancies from the original requirements.
5. Deployment: after the software passes testing it is deployed to a production environment where end users can access and use it.
6.  Maintanance and support:the software enters the maintance phase where it is updated and improved based on the user's feedback and new requirements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Flexibility:
-in waterfall it is rigid; changes are difficult once development starts.
-in agile it is highly adaptable to changing requirements.

scenarios
-waterfall: Health or medical devices; devoloping softwares for a medical imaging device.
-agile: Mobile app development; creating a ride-sharing app where features evolve based on customers need.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer
-responsible for designing, coding and maintaining software applications.
-They write, test, and debug code based on software requirements.
QA Engineer
-ensures that software meets quality standards before release.
- The design and execute test plans, test cases and test scripts.
 Project Manager
  -Oversee the project lifecycle, ensuring it stays on track, within budget and meets business objectives.
  -They define the project scope , goals and deliverables.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs:They enhance productivity, improve code quality and fascilitates collaboration.
an example is Visual studio code
VSC : they prevent data loss, fascilitates team collaboration and maintain history of modifications.
an example is GitHub

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.debugging and fixing bugs
-implement unit tests and intergration tests to catch errors early.
2.Security and data privacy concerns
-follow a secure coding practicess.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. unit:focuses on testing individual functions of the software in isolation to ensure they work correctly
   -helps detects bugs earlyin the development process
2.intergration:checks how different components of an application work together
-identifies defects in module interaction.
3. System: evaluates the entire application as a whole to verify it meets the specified requirements.
 -tests the software in an environment similar to production.
4.Acceptance: determines wheteher the software meets business and user requirements before deployments.
-ensures the software is ready to be released for end users.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
the designing and refining of input prompts  to optomize the responses of AI models. Its importance is to enhance output quality, reduce ambiguity and misinterpretation and etc.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-an example of vague prompt is "Tell me about machine learning"
-improved prompt " Explain machine learning in simple terms with real-world examples, focusing on its application in healthcare and finance."
The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear, specific, concise and would recieve a better AI reponse.
